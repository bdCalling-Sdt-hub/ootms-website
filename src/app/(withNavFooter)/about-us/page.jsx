              We begin by collecting and organizing objective data from the
              patient’s health records, medications, and diagnostic tests. This
              raw, factual data is crucial for understanding the client’s

            <p className="text-base-color text-justify leading-relaxed">
              Next, we integrate this data with subjective analysis, where our
              MVRs identify potential risks and challenges that may impact the
              patient’s future health. This analysis lays the groundwork for
              personalized health strategies.
